I create fakewhatsapp using my JavaScript nodejs and ejs knowladge in webdevlopment.

This is a message app that show your chat.

when was I studing Ejs then I created this app.

Why I create this app ? Making this app helped me understand ejs in whole new way.

ðŸ’¡ Key Features of EJS:
Simple syntax: <%= variable %> to insert values, <% %> for logic (if, loops, etc.)
Works well with Express.js. 
This app is great pratice for ejs.
During app creation I enjoy to much.
